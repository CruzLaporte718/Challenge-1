# Challenge-1

## The Purpose of this repository is to showcase my progress throughout the bootcamp course.This is my first Challenge/homework.

## Update/refactoring source code

## User Story:
### A Marketing Agency requires a Source code that meets accessibility standards so that its site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria:
### Observe the Source Code 
#### Originally when I looked over the code it looked simple, but then i noticed it had alot of "div" elements

### Locate Semantic HTML elements
#### There were no Semantic HTML elements present, I added in "section" Semantic tags in place of the "div" tags in the main body, I also added an "aside" element in place of the "div" elements above the "footer" with "section" tags nested inside.

### Review the Structure of the HTML file, make sure it follows a logical path
#### Upon Observation the stucture follows a standard top to bottom format, "!DOCUTYPE" "HTML" "head""body""footer".

### Locate Icon and Image elements add Alt attributes 
#### I found the image elements and added Alt attributes followed by a simple name that describes the image.

### Review the heading, make sure that all attributes are in sequential order
#### I looked at the header and placed the Link for CSS under the title only because it looks better ,I dont think it makes a difference syntax wise.

### Locate title and give it a more descriptive name
#### I changed the name of the title from "website" to "Horiseon".
